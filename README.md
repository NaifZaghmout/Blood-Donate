## Bugs and Remaining Bugs


#### Bugs 

1. Login Issue with Fetch

- **Error Handling with Fetch:**

**Issue:** The 'fetch' API used for login lacked robust error handling, resulting in unclear error messages for users with incorrect credentials.
**Symptoms:** Users encountered difficulties understanding login failures due to insufficient error feedback.
**Resolution:** Switching to axios improved error handling, providing clear and specific error messages for login failures.

  -  **Before:** Inadequate error handling with fetch

`fetch("api/login", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify(formData),
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
})
.then(response => {
  // Inadequate error handling
})
.catch(error => {
  // Inadequate error handling
});`

  - **After:** Clear and specific error handling with axios

`try {
  const response = await axios.post("api/login", formData);
  // Clear and specific error handling
} catch (error) {
  // Clear and specific error handling
}`




2. Unable to Save Updated Donor Information

**Issue:** After making changes to donor information and clicking the "Save" button, the application does not save the updated information, and there is no success message.

**Symptoms:** Users attempting to save updated donor information encountered the following issues **(Inability to Trigger Save Actions)**


**Resolution:** After investigating the issue, it was discovered that the handleSubmit function was not correctly updating the donor information. The formData object was not being sent properly in the axios.put request.

  -  **Before:**

`const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    try {
        await axios.put(`api/resolve/${Donorid}/`, formData);
        // ... (Old code)
    } catch (error) {
        // ... (Old handling)
    }
};`


  -  **After:**

  `const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    try {
        await axios.put(`api/resolve/${Donorid}/`, formData);
        swal({
            title: "Updated",
            text: "Updated Successfully",
            icon: "success",
            buttons: false,
            timer: 2000,
        });
        setNameData("");
        setRender(true);
    } catch (error) {
        
    }
};`


 **Explanation:** The 'swal' (SweetAlert) success message and the state updates were not being triggered. By restructuring the code within the try block, we ensure that the success message is displayed, and the relevant state changes are applied after a successful API request.

This resolution should fix the issue, and now the donor information should be updated successfully.



#### Remaining Bugs

- None 



## Issue 

### Issue: Frequent Rebase in Gitpod

#### Problem
Encountering recurring rebase conflicts in Gitpod due to concurrent development efforts. The situation is exacerbated by the late adoption of Agile methodology after the project initiation, leading to increased frequency of code changes.

#### Impact
- Disrupts development workflow.
- Increases the risk of overlooking critical changes.
- Requires constant manual conflict resolution during rebase.

#### Resolution

1. **Communication:**
   - Establish clear communication channels for code changes coordination.
   - Encourage team members to communicate development plans to minimize overlap.

2. **Branching Strategy:**
   - Adopt a feature branching strategy to isolate and manage specific features.

3. **Pulling Strategy:**
   - Encourage regular pulling of changes from the main branch to local branches.
   - Use `git pull --rebase` for a cleaner integration.

#### Agile Methodology Integration (Late Adoption)

**Problem:**
- Agile methodology was introduced late in the project after the mentor section, causing a delay in its benefits.

**Resolution:**
- Strike a balance between Agile's iterative development and effective communication.
- Ensure team members are aligned with Agile practices to minimize disruptions.
- Consider conducting a retrospective to identify areas for improvement and streamline Agile integration.

## Agile development methodology


- Agile development methodology GitHub issues and JIRA Project Management tool were used to document and track an agile development approach. A JIRA board was created to represent the product backlog. All user stories were initially added to the product backlog.
Development work was planned using a series of iterations each with a timebox of three working days, representing a total 11 story points (although the duration of each iteration in calendar days was variable due to fitting the three working days around work and other commitments).
A JIRA project board was created for each iteration, and user stories moved from the product backlog into the relevant iteration as each cycle of work began. User stories were labelled as 'must have', 'could have' or 'should have' goals for that specific iteration, and assigned story point values. Story points for 'must have' user stories never exceeded 6 (60%). 
A project kanban board was used to track progress, with user stories moved between 'Todo', 'In Progress' and 'Done' columns as appropriate. For example, the BD project board was captured at the start, in the middle and at the end:

## Bugs and Remaining Bugs


#### Bugs 

1. Login Issue with Fetch

- **Error Handling with Fetch:**

**Issue:** The 'fetch' API used for login lacked robust error handling, resulting in unclear error messages for users with incorrect credentials.
**Symptoms:** Users encountered difficulties understanding login failures due to insufficient error feedback.
**Resolution:** Switching to axios improved error handling, providing clear and specific error messages for login failures.

  -  **Before:** Inadequate error handling with fetch

`fetch("api/login", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify(formData),
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
  },
})
.then(response => {
  // Inadequate error handling
})
.catch(error => {
  // Inadequate error handling
});`

  - **After:** Clear and specific error handling with axios

`try {
  const response = await axios.post("api/login", formData);
  // Clear and specific error handling
} catch (error) {
  // Clear and specific error handling
}`




2. Unable to Save Updated Donor Information

**Issue:** After making changes to donor information and clicking the "Save" button, the application does not save the updated information, and there is no success message.

**Symptoms:** Users attempting to save updated donor information encountered the following issues **(Inability to Trigger Save Actions)**


**Resolution:** After investigating the issue, it was discovered that the handleSubmit function was not correctly updating the donor information. The formData object was not being sent properly in the axios.put request.

  -  **Before:**

`const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    try {
        await axios.put(`api/resolve/${Donorid}/`, formData);
        // ... (Old code)
    } catch (error) {
        // ... (Old handling)
    }
};`


  -  **After:**

  `const handleSubmit = async (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    try {
        await axios.put(`api/resolve/${Donorid}/`, formData);
        swal({
            title: "Updated",
            text: "Updated Successfully",
            icon: "success",
            buttons: false,
            timer: 2000,
        });
        setNameData("");
        setRender(true);
    } catch (error) {
        
    }
};`


 **Explanation:** The 'swal' (SweetAlert) success message and the state updates were not being triggered. By restructuring the code within the try block, we ensure that the success message is displayed, and the relevant state changes are applied after a successful API request.

This resolution should fix the issue, and now the donor information should be updated successfully.

## Deployment

Follow these steps to deploy your Django project on Render:

### 1. Create an Account on Render

- Go to the [Render](https://render.com/) website.
- Sign up for an account if you don't have one.

### 2. Create a New Web Service

- After logging in, click on the "Create" button to create a new web service.
- Choose "Web Service" from the available options.

### 3. Configure Your Service

- Select the deployment region that is closest to your target audience.
- Choose the "Django" preset from the list of presets.
- Set the "Environment" to "Python."
- Enter your repository URL, for example, `https://github.com/NaifZaghmout/Blood-Donate`.

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

- Add environment variables required for your Django project (e.g., `SECRET_KEY`, `DEBUG`, `DATABASE_URL`, etc.).
- In Render, you can add environment variables in the "Environment" section of your web service settings.

### 5. Set Up Your Database

- If you're using a database, configure the database settings.
- Render provides options for different types of databases, including managed PostgreSQL.

### 6. Specify Start Command

- In the "Advanced" section, set the start command for your Django application. Typically, this would be something like `cd bloodbackend && gunicorn bloodbackend.wsgi`.

### 7. Configure Automatic Deployments

- Set up automatic deployments from your Git repository. Render will automatically deploy updates when you push changes to your repository.

### 8. Review and Deploy

- Review your settings and click the "Create Web Service" button to deploy your Django application.

### 9. Wait for Deployment

- Render will automatically build and deploy your Django application. You can monitor the deployment progress in the Render dashboard.

### 10. Access Your Application

- Once the deployment is complete, you can access your Django application using the provided Render URL (`https://stockholm-blood-donate-organization.onrender.com`).

### 11. Custom Domains (Optional)

- If you have a custom domain, you can configure it in the Render dashboard.

That's it! Your Django project should now be successfully deployed on Render. Make sure to update your database, collect static files, and perform any other necessary tasks as part of your Django deployment process.
